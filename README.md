🚀 Java DSA Practice Repository

This repository contains my Java-based Data Structures and Algorithms practice code.
I created this repo to improve my problem-solving skills and strengthen core concepts for interviews.

📌 About This Repository

This repo includes:

✔ Java solutions to common DSA problems

✔ Practice code for interviews

✔ Clean & simple implementations

✔ Step-by-step logic building

✔ Arrays, Strings, Searching, Sorting & more

I update this repository regularly as I practice more DSA problems.
